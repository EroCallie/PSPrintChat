Basically an example plugin script for the PlexstormBot that essentially dumps everything to console so you can better 
understand how it all works!

It has a singular trigger called `!trigger` that shows how those might be implemented as well, plus some comments that 
show how a couple of other functions might be used in a script.

There are no special dependencies or requirements for this script.
